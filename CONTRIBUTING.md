## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Prerequisites**
   - .NET 9.0 SDK or later
   - Node.js 14+ and npm
   - Docker Desktop (for local Kubernetes testing)
   - Git

2. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sse-realtime-demo.git
   cd sse-realtime-demo
   ```

3. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
dotnet test

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Code Style Guidelines

#### C# (.NET Backend)

- Follow [Microsoft's C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods focused and small
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Follow SOLID principles

#### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use functional components with hooks
- Properly type all props and state
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Add JSDoc comments for complex logic

#### General Guidelines

- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments only when necessary to explain "why" not "what"
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Update documentation when changing functionality

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a simplified version of Conventional Commits:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or corrections
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add typed event support for SSE client
fix: resolve connection timeout in Kubernetes deployment
docs: update README with production scaling guidelines
```

### Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Add inline documentation for complex logic
- Update architecture diagrams if you change the system design
- Include examples for new features
